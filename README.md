# Download
Due to its large size, dataset is hosted by Google Drive and can be downwloaded from:

[Download Raw GARNN Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bbv-vp9mH-0Ck2fM2EmrdYcKovJjDRl2/view?usp=sharing)

# Content
Downloaded file *garnn-rawData.tgz* can be extracted by running "tar -xzvf garnn-rawData.tgz" if using Linux environment.

This tarball file contains over 1000 pairs of LR/HR images which were captured by our dual-sensor fiber bundle imaging system (see Fig.1). Particularly, there are 4 types of sample in this dataset:

- lens tissue
- kidney
- liver
- tonsil

And for each sample type above, there are also 4 different brightness settings.

# Scope
This dataset can be used as testbed for new image processing/deep learning algorithms which improve fiber bundle imaging systems.
